# Solve sudoku

Practice the matching question: [LeetCode #37: Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/).

Fill empty Sudoku cells in place while respecting row, column, and box constraints.

## Practice

Read the task and trusted tests. Keep public reference solutions unchanged.
Create or reopen a private attempt, then edit the solution path it prints.
Keep entry-point names and signatures. The attempt runner refreshes trusted tests.

```bash
npm run practice -- start 13_backtracking/problems/solve_sudoku py
# Edit the private solution path printed above.
npm run practice -- attempt 13_backtracking/problems/solve_sudoku py
```

Repeat the exercise from your explanation before you compare reference solutions.
Use [private progress and reviews](../../../README.md#find-exercises-and-schedule-reviews) to record the result.

## Files

| Language | Solution | Entry points | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|

This folder preserves the existing language coverage. Only the files listed above
have implementations and tests; the runner reports an error for an unavailable language.
